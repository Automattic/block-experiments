Stars in motion

== Description ==

Everything was made of collapsing stars, we are all made of star stuff. Now we also can create content in WordPress with stars in motion.

## Requirements

As this is part of a series of block experiments, the latest version of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg Plugin</a> is required.

## Source and Support

You can follow development, file an issue, suggest features, and view the source at the Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/block-experiments">https://github.com/Automattic/block-experiments</a>
