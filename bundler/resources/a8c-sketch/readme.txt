Sketch and draw freely on a canvas with brush strokes that feel natural.

== Description ==

Sketch and draw freely on a canvas with brush strokes that feel natural. Pick among three different brush sizes and the color palette of the site. The block has a transparent background so it can be layered on top of any container block, like groups or background images to achieve different effects.

## Requirements

This is an initial beta release that requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg Plugin</a> to work.

## Credits

The block is powered by the awesome <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/perfect-freehand">perfect-freehand</a> library.

## Source and Support

You can follow development, file an issue, suggest features, and view the source at the Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/block-experiments">https://github.com/Automattic/block-experiments</a>
