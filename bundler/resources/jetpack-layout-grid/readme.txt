A Gutenberg container block to let you align items consistently across a global grid.

== Description ==

Want to create a column-based layout with easily customizable column-width and positions? Or perhaps you want to align your content to a global layout grid across your post. With this Layout Grid block you can do both or either. There are also options to provide specific layouts to mobile or tablet breakpoints. Pick a number of columns (1-4), then go ahead and resize and position each column as you want them to look, for any screen. Optionally apply background colours and paddings to add emphasis.
