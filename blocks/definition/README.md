# Definition block

A block to display a term and definition or abbreviation with semantic markup ( `<dl />`, `<dfn />`, `<abbr />` etc).

Features:

- Online definition lookup
- Semantic markup of definitions and abbreviations

### TODO

- [ ] Multiple dictionary sources, and the ability to add one's own API key.
- [ ] Support a list of definitions, or an accordion style for glossary pages that have lots of definitions in them
- [ ] Add definition image/thumbnail option 
- [ ] Add audio tag for pronunciation example
- [ ] A permalink / easy to copy anchor link to the definition from the front-end
