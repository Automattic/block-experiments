## Draft content editing block

This is currently just an experimental block that allows easier drafting of post text content, which can then be converted to blocks for more complex formatting once the text is finalised.

### Why?

One criticism of the block editor over the old classic editor is that it can be a distracting enviroment for those that are drafting long form posts as apposed to contructing website pages. Although the level of distraction can be reduced by pinning the block toolbar to the top, copying and pasting, particularly getting partial text between two paragraph blocks, is not as fluid and easy as in a standard text editor.

This block allows very quick and easy text editing, with basic text formatting, for initial post writing, which can then be converted to standard paragraph blocks to allow all the flexibility of the block editor for final formatting.
